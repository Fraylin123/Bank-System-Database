Worked in a group of 3 to design a Bank System database by utilizing industry best practices for database design.
 
- Specified business rules requirements for the database system
- Represented business rule requirements by visualizing them through an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram and creating a logical schema.
- Used SQL to create database tables and enforced entity, referential, and domain integrity.
- Populated database and wrote SQL statements to query and manipulate its data.
- Highlighted functional dependencies and normalized relations to Third Normal Form (3NF) to mitigate data redundancy and eliminate data manipulation anomalies.
